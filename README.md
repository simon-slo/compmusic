The corpus consists of two playlists. One of these playlists consists "finished" hiphop songs (instrumentals + vocals) while the other contains the instrumental versions of the same songs. For now, the corpus is exclusive to hiphop songs and instrumentals, as hiphop is one of the genres where a lot of emphasis and value is given to the instrumentals (and thus there are more full albums (that I know of) that have both their instrumentals and full songs on spotify in this genre). 

I have made two plots. The first one compares the energy levels in the instrumental versions and the versions with vocals in a histogram. Here, you can see that the median lies significantly higher in the versions with vocals. This would suggest that adding vocals over an instrumental gives the song more intensity and activity.
In the other graph, where valence is mapped out in a similar histogram, you can see a similar pattern as in the energy histogram. In the versions with vocals, the vast majority of the songs have an energy level greater than 0.3, while there is a significantly bigger portion of the songs that fall underneath that threshold in the instrumental versions.
